<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tetris is a popular game developed in 1984-86 by Alexey 
Pajitnov (Pazhitnov), Dmitry Pavlovsky, and me. Pajitnov and Pavlovsky were 
computer engineers at the Computer Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences. I 
was a 16-year-old high school student. My computer science teacher Arkady 
Borkovsky brought me to the Computer Center 
where I worked and played with IBM PCs. I quickly learned&nbsp;programming and 
enjoyed working on various fun computer projects. </font> </p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dmitry noticed me when I was writing a directory encryption 
program for MS DOS. He told me that he liked computer games and had designed a 
few games for a mainframe computer. He asked me if I was interested in 
helping him to convert the games to the PC and to work together on new game 
ideas. I was obviously very interested. Pavlovsky showed me his games and gave 
me the source code of one of them. On the next day I made a PC version of his game. We 
started working together.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Very soon Dmitry introduced me to his friend Alexey Pajitnov 
who was also interested in making computer games. Dmitry told me that Alexey had 
even managed to sell some of his psychology-related games. Alexey showed us a 
couple of games he developed earlier. We decided to work as a team. My roles 
were a PC expert, programmer, and graphics designer.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our plan was to make about a dozen addictive computer games 
for the PC and put them together in one system we called a computer funfair. 
Pajitnov and Pavlovsky also thought about selling the games. The selling part 
seemed unusual and difficult because we lived in the Soviet Union. Making 
and selling something privately was highly irregular. We 
focused on making development tools for the PC, converting earlier games to the PC, and developing new game ideas.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a few weeks we had converted most of the worthy older 
games and developed a good set of libraries to support graphics (4-color 
320x200), text, and sound in our games. We gathered quite often to discuss new 
ideas, and to code the games. In a few months we had a nice set of games. 
Most of those games are probably lost. I recently found only one of them. The 
game was a remake of Xonix with an inverted hidden play field. Dmitry named it 
<a href="http://vadim.oversigma.com/Antix.zip">Antix (short for Antixonix)</a>. Warning: the game does not 
have a proper timer delay and runs too fast on modern computers unless you use 
some emulation software. I do not know who developed the original Xonix. But 
the game was a smashing success at the Computer Center and elsewhere around 
Moscow before Tetris spread around.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few months after we started working together, Pajitnov came 
up with the Tetris idea. Before we met he had a computer game called Genetic 
Engineering. In that game the player had to move the 4-square pieces (tetramino) 
around the screen using cursor keys. The player could assemble various shapes. I don't remember the exact objective of that game, but it 
seemed rather dull.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At one of our meetings Pajitnov told Pavlovsky and me about 
his new idea of tetramino falling into a rectangular glass and piling up at the 
bottom. He believed the game might be successful. Shortly after discussing the 
idea Pajitnov made a prototype for Electronica 60, then I ported it to the PC 
using our development system. Pajitnov and I kept adding features to the program 
for a couple of years.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The game name "Tetris" was purely Alexey's idea. The 
		word is a combination of "tetramino" and "tennis". I thought it sounded 
		a bit strange in Russian, but Pajitnov insisted on giving the game this 
		name.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A couple of years later Pajitnov and I also developed a 2-player version of 
Tetris and worked on a couple of psychological test projects for Alexey's friend
<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.05/tetris.html">Vladimir Pokhilko</a>. 
Vladimir was the first clinical psychologist who conducted experiments with 
Tetris. In the 2-player 
Tetris the glass had no bottom. The pieces for the first player move from the 
top, for the second - from the bottom. Two players competed for the space 
inside.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pajitnov's efforts to sell the games together failed. We 
decided to give our friends free copies of the games including Tetris. The games 
quickly spread around. When the freely distributed PC version of Tetris got 
outside of the Soviet Union and a foreign company expressed an interest in 
licensing Tetris, Pajitnov decided to abandon all the games but Tetris. The 
decision made Pavlovsky very unhappy and destroyed our team.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1991 Pajitnov moved 
		to the USA with his friend Vladimir Pokhilko.&nbsp; Pavlovsky 
immigrated to UK in 1990. </font>
</p>
		<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tetris has generated a 
		lot of revenue for sometimes unexpected organizations and people and caused a few 
		nasty legal clashes. You can read about 
the business side of&nbsp;the story in the book

		BBC documentary</a> filmed in 2003-2004 portrays some of the 
		events and presents views of a few key people involved in the business 
		turmoil.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alexey Pajitnov and an American 
entrepreneur Henk Rogers founded
the Tetris Company. I have nothing to do with the company, and do not 
support <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,16619,00.html">its policy</a>. Contrary to 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010922175529/http:/www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2430/a-r1.html">the claim 
attributed to Henk Rogers</a> there were no 
"straightforward business arrangement" between Pajitnov and myself. In the 
Soviet Union, where private business was outlawed and the concept of 
intellectual property was not defined, people could not make private business 
arrangements of this kind. The Computer Center of Academy of Sciences owned 
everything we made. Several years later the situation in the Soviet Union 
changed, but this was a different story. When I worked on Tetris, even a 
government organization could not formally hire me because I was underage. I 
worked on Tetris just for fun. I don't remember Pajitnov ever paying me for 
anything related to Tetris either. Pajitnov started fixing the business aspects 
of the situation a few years later when he and Henk Rogers participated in 
negotiations with Elorg (the only government organization in the USSR that 
could sell software abroad). Pajitnov stopped by my home 
and asked me to urgently sign a paper "to get lots of money for us from game 
companies". He didn't leave me a copy of the paper. As far as I remember the 
paper was saying that I agree to only claim porting Tetris to the PC, agree to 
give Pajitnov the right to handle all business arrangements, and refuse any 
rewards related to Tetris. I did not entirely agree with the content, but I 
trusted Alexey and signed the paper anyway. In a few months my name disappeared 
from all newly released versions of Tetris and all Tetris-related documents. Alexey registered a US copyright (R/N <span class="main_txt">
PA-412-170</span>) referencing the free PC version of Tetris (<span class="main_txt">original 
version 3.12</span>) we developed together.</font></p>

		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">The first MS DOS version of Tetris was implemented a few days after 
		Alexey put together his first prototype of the game for the Electronica 
		60. All three of us - Dmitry, Alexey, and I - were fans of Pascal and 
		structured programming despite then-recently-published text
		<a href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html">"Real 
		Programmers Don't Use Pascal"</a>. We used various flavors of Pascal to 
		implement our game ideas. Under MS DOS the development system of choice 
		was Borland's Turbo Pascal. I started learning programming with
		<a href="http://community.borland.com/article/20693">v1.0</a>. In fact, 
		I still enjoy programming in the descendant of Turbo Pascal - Borland 
		Delphi. The last version of Tetris, we worked on together, was compiled 
		with Turbo Pascal 4. That last version of the game had number 3.12. 
		Although 3.12 is pretty much an arbitrary number as we did not have a 
		strict versioning policy. By the way, this version has an Easter Egg. 
		Although not a sophisticated one. I wonder if anyone can discover it. 
		</font> </p>
		<p align="justify">
		<font face="Verdana" size="2">The MS DOS version is quite different from the Electronica 60 draft 
		which initially had just the glass and a score count. That version 
		worked on a monochromatic (green/black) alphanumeric display. The 
		tetramino squares were drawn as a pair of square brackets [ ]. 
		Remarkably, the game was playable and addictive even in that form. This 
		gave us a reason to hurry up with the MS DOS implementation. I believe 
		Alexey expanded his Electronica version of the game after we ported it 
		to the PC to match some of the features we had in our PC games. I never 
		worked with Electronica computers myself.</font></p>
		<p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We diligently implemented the MS DOS version of the 
		game in such a way that it could run on any PC we had available. The 
		program&nbsp; ran in a text mode using colored space symbols to 
		represent squares of teraminos. The game could even automatically 
		recognize the IBM monochrome card adjusting the way it drew (printed) on 
		the screen. The clock-frequency race had already started with the 
		introduction of IBM PC AT and PC clones. Many games released for the 
		earlier PC and PC XT (4.77 MHz) models ran too fast on the newer 
		machines. The last version of our game was one of the first to use 
		proper timer delays. 20 years later the same program 
		still runs without any changes, looks and feels the same (especially in 
		the full screen DOS box). </font>
